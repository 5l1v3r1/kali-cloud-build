# debian "squeeze" bootstrapping script for EC2 #

This is a fork of camptocamps bootstrapping script for EC2 AMIs. It creates a
vanilla debian squeeze machine image, no latent logfiles no .bash\_history or
even apt package cache.  The machine configuration this script creates has been
thoroughly tested.

*This script is only tested on debian squeeze.*
*You will need an EC2 server to run this bootstrapper.*

## Usage ##

The script is started with ``./ec2debian-build-ami`` it has sensible defaults
but can be configured with options and plugins. To see a list of options run
``./ec2debian-build-ami --help``.  

At the very least, the script needs to know your AWS credentials.
I recommend setting them via an [environment script](#environment-script), this
way you do not need to specify the parameters for every invocation.

There are no interactive prompts, the bootstrapping can run entirely unattended
from start till finish.

Some plugins are included in the [plugins directory](https://github.com/andsens/ec2debian-build-ami/tree/master/plugins).
A list of external plugins is also provided there.  If none of those scratch
your itch, you can of course [write your own plugin](https://github.com/andsens/ec2debian-build-ami/blob/master/plugins/HOWTO.md).
